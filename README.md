My solutions to the problems from Advent of Code 2016,
which can be found here: http://adventofcode.com/2016/

Of course these will contain spoilers, so I recommend
you look at the problems before you look at my code. 

Also my main goal is to solve these as quickly as possible. 
Usually I refactor the code a bit before I push, 
but it's definitely not the nicest code I've written.
